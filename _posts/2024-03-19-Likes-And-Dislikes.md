# Likes 
- Multiplayer
- Obstacles
- The wall climbing
- the settings
- The goombas

# Dislikes
- The glitches
- The sprite animation isn't smooth
- The sprite animation glitches
- highscore is broken
- make the leaderboard work when pressed
- there is no timer for the game

## hacks

# Timer
- I fixed the timer by importing GameControl.js into Gamesetup.js setting up the timer to work with already existing code. I added GameControl.starttimer to start the timer whenever the start game is clicked.
# Lopez
- I fixed the Lopez glitch by making the tube bigger to fit Lopez into the tube without his sprite slightly out of the tube by adjusting the width of the tube. Because I adjusted te tube by adding 100 into the width of the Tube Mr lopez would be able to fit into the tube if more adjustments.
