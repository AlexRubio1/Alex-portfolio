# Likes 
- Multiplayer
- Obstacles
- The wall climbing
- the settings
- The goombas

# Dislikes
- The glitches
- The sprite animation isn't smooth
- The sprite animation glitches
- highscore is broken
- make the leaderboard work when pressed

## hacks

# Timer
- I fixed the timer by importing GameControl.js into Gamesetup.js setting up the timer to work with already existing code. I added GameControl.starttimer to start the timer whenever the start game is clicked.
# Lopez
- I fixed the Lopez glitch by making the tube bigger to fit Lopez into the tube without his sprite slightly out of the tube by adjusting the width of the tube.
